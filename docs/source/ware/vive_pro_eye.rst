Vive Pro Eye
============

Summary
-------
The Vive Pro Eye provides eye gaze tracking as well as detailed eye expression tracking. It is a *built-in* eye-tracking device (no additional hardware setup required). Eye tracking data is accessed through Vive's SRanipal interface.

Setup
-----

1. Follow the Vive setup instructions for the headset. Make sure that the headset cable is not damaged, and make sure to plug in the USB connection from the linkbox to a USB 3.0 port (usually *blue* internal connector tab)
2. Install the SRanipal runtime software


Common Hardware Issues
----------------------

- A regular Vive Pro is occasionally mistaken to be a Vive Pro Eye. A Vive Pro Eye will have **light blue** rings around the front two passthrough cameras and a plastic covered IR LED ring on the inside
