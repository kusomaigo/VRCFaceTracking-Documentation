VRCFaceTracking Program

   Document under construction

VRChat has no native implementation of Vive' SRanipal software needed to interface with the Facial Tracker, which means there must be an intermediary software accessing the face tracking data and sending it to VRC via OSC.
This would be VRCFaceTracking.
